#### Choosing a Text Editor ####

While reading the prescribed text I learned that it doesn't really matter which text editor you choose. You can get away with something as simple as Notepad for basic coding. What's important is knowing what a text editor is, why you need one. The answer for that is pretty simple as well. It's in the name, it simply allows you to edit text. You want something that feels good to you and that allows you to accomplish creating websites. The only way to figure that out is to pick one and go, become proficient with it and then when you start another project, pick another one and try that one.

As you progress you'll likely learn that not all text editors are created equally and there isn't one perfect option. But there will be tools that you look for in each one that will help make your job as a coder a little easier. One such feature is code completion, which will predict what code you are using and allow you to hit a single button and finish the code for you. There are others as well, mostly that deal with themes and how the code appears as you type it, all of this will be left up to personal preference.

The most important part is too simply start coding, searching all day for the 'perfect' text editor won't matter if you don't know how to code. Lastly, there is something called Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and tht basically takes a bunch of different software and packages it all together. I wouldn't worry about this for now, just know it's out there and once you know the basics of coding, it can make your life easier. But jumping in right away will probably just confuse you a bit.
