Javascript

-JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
In the JavaScript code we have a function called say_hi. It used the getElementById we have already seen to locate the DOM element representing the input element with the id first_name. The object returned has a method value that will return the text the user has typed in that field.

We use this technique to retrieve the content of both input fields and assign their content to two variables: fname and lname.

Then, using these variable we create an HTML snippet and assign it to a new variable called html.

Then we set the innerHTML attribute as earlier to show the HTML we generated. The result might look like this:
-EX.
  <html>
<head>
  <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
 
First name: <input id="first_name">
Last name: <input id="last_name">
<button id="say">Say hi!</button>
 
<hr>
<div id="result"></div>
 
<script>
function say_hi() {
    var fname = document.getElementById('first_name').value;
    var lname = document.getElementById('last_name').value;
 
    var html = 'Hello <b>' + fname + '</b> ' + lname;
 
    document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = html;
}
 
document.getElementById('say').addEventListener('click', say_hi);
</script>
 
</body>
</html>
